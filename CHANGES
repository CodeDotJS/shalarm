0.9     Initial release

1.0     Can't remember.  Probably just fixed spelling errors and such.

1.1     Edited the man page and readme.  Also changed the default configuration
        file path to /etc/shalarm.cfg, made it so that the script will attempt
        to copy the default config to ~/.config/shalarm/shalarm.cfg if that
        file doesn't exist, and changed the default path for the sound file to
        /usr/share/shalarm/ring.wav
