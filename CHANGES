0.9     Initial release

1.0     Can't remember.  Probably just fixed spelling errors and such.

1.1     Edited the man page and readme.  Also changed the default configuration
        file path to /etc/shalarm.cfg, made it so that the script will attempt
        to copy the default config to ~/.config/shalarm/shalarm.cfg if that
        file doesn't exist, and changed the default path for the sound file to
        /usr/share/shalarm/ring.wav

1.2     stormdragon2976 (https://github.com/stormdragon2976) added the ability
        to use a short fortune for your alarm message.

1.3     Added an 'alarmRepeat' option to better accommodate the fortune option.

1.4     Antoine Nguyen requested a feature allowing the alarm to shut itself off
        after a certain length of time if left unattended, as well as a snooze
        feature.  Both were added.  In addition, some typos / version errors
        were fixed.

1.5     Added command-line args for snooze and timeout options.

1.6     Changed the sleep interval to .5 seconds, just to be safe.
