Usage:
    shalarm [OPTION / TIME]

Requirements:
    You'll need a media player of some sort to actually get anything out of this
    script.  I recommend 'mplayer' or something similar.

Installation:
    You don't really need to install this (it's a shell script), but it makes
    things a little easier if you do.  To do so, as superuser and within the
    root directory to which you've extracted the archive, type 'make install'.

Uninstallation:
    Similar to the above, except you type 'make uninstall' instead.

Description:
    It's just an alarm clock written as a bash script.  Use it however you'd use
    an alarm.  Usually, one uses an alarm clock to wake oneself up from slumber.

    I'd recommend trying it with the --test option before attempting to use this
    in any serious capacity, however.

    NOTE:  All times are in 24-hour format.

Arguments:
    -h or --help:
        Print a help screen

    -v or --version:
        Print version and author info

    -t or --test:
        Test out the alarm (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
